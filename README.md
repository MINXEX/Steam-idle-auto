# **Steam Idle Master** 🎮💻

## **Overview** 🌟  
Steam Idle Master is a program that automatically generates a batch file to idle all the games in your Steam library. By using your Steam profile, it fetches your game list and, with the help of **Idle Master**, creates a batch file that runs all games without opening them, grinding hours for you.

This process consumes almost no computer power and has no impact on your system performance. ⚡

## **How to Use** 🚀

1. **Download the Files**:  
   - Download and extract the project files to a folder on your computer.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   - Open `Steam-idle.py`. The script will generate a batch file containing commands to idle all your Steam games.

3. **Extract to Desktop**:  
   - After the script runs, extract the generated batch file to your desktop.

4. **Run the Batch File**:  
   - Double-click the batch file (`steam_idle_commands.bat`) to begin idling your games. It will start all the games in your Steam library and increment hours automatically.

5. **Shut Down**:  
   - To stop all idle processes, simply run the `shutdown.bat` file, which will terminate all Steam Idle windows and return your system to normal. 📴
